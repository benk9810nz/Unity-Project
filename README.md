# Unity Project – Game Development 2019 </p>
## Introduction
This Unity Project is a Game that I worked within a group to create for our Game Development course at the Southern Institute of Technology (Year 2).
I worked in a group creating this game, with my fellow Team Members Henry Sly, Jayekib den_Dulk and Holly Johnston. As part of the 4 Team Member Crew, I was designated as the Project and Team Manager who was overall in charge of the Project as well as its organising.
We created a racer game where the goal is to get from the start to finish without
## Roles & Responsibility
For this Project I was responsible and in charge of the Project Documentation (required for the project submission) as well as responsible for the Creation of the Scripts for the User Interface Menus (Title and Pause Menu) as well as other scripts required for the Player, Wall and Enemy of the game. I was also responsible for the creation of the appearance and layout of the Menus, as well as the general flow of the game.
Once the scripts were created these were then combined and put together by my fellow team member Henry, who also created the look and designs of the levels with Holly and Jayekib’s Help.
## How to run Reality Warp
Reality Warp can be launched by downloading the Finished (Built Game) folder, and then double clicking the Project.exe executable.
